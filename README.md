# Fibonacci Series
Fibonacci series is a series of numbers given by : 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8, ... , N.  
Sequence is generated by Fib(n)=Fib(n-1)+Fib(n-2), where n>1.
Fibonacci Series app can be used to generate Fibonacci numbers upto 1000000'th Fib. 
Big integer class is being used to compute large numbers, as the length of the numbers to computed is as large as 30000 digits.
